short_desc : "Spindle models with 41 kW power for demanding machining on stable machining centers or turning-milling centers."
long_desc : "With 41 kW power and a speed of 15,000 rpm, these spindle models are ideally equipped for demanding machining operations on stable machining centers or turning-milling centers. Hydraulic clamping of the spindle shaft is installed for turning applications. Nevertheless, this spindle manages with ball bearings with grease bearings. This enables significant cost savings when equipping the machine, since the more complex oil-air lubrication is completely eliminated. Due to the very precisely manufactured individual parts, the spindle has less imbalance and the clever cooling reduces the increase in length to a minimum."
