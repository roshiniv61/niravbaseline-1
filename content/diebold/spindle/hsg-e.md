long_desc : "Diebold presents particularly service-friendly and economical HSK insert spindles for high-performance milling. This innovative spindle concept impresses with its compact design and the grease storage, which offers significant cost savings compared to the more complex oil-air lubrication.
The spindles are designed as slide-in spindles and can be quickly exchanged with little effort. The housing shape can be freely selected:Cylindrical Housing for clevis Housing for a swivel head flanged on one side For direct installation in torque axes
Due to the extremely precisely manufactured individual parts, the spindle has less imbalance. The clever cooling reduces the growth in length to a minimum. "
