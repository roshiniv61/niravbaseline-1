                         The Diebold FKS 04 S is a patented liquid cooler for fast, contour-independent cooling, cleaning and preservation of shrink fit chucks.
                         The housing of the FKS 04 S is filled with cooling water from below. The water is raised into the tower by means of compressed air and flows around the tool to be cooled in a ring. As a result, the concentricity of the tool remains unchanged. If the tool were to be showered, the concentricity would be significantly impaired due to distortion.
                         Cooling height: 380mm
                         Cooling time: approx. 40 sec. 
                         For all tool interfaces "
