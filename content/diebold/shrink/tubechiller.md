                            For innovative shrinking and automatic cooling of shrink fit tool holders we offer our newest technology called „TubeChiller™“. This technology was developed to combine our shrink unit series US 1100 with automatic cooling. The units work fully automatic and after the shrink fit process, tool holders are cooled down automatically so that it is impossible for operators to touch hot tools.
                            After the shrink process the tube of the chiller unit lifts automatically from the base. At the same time the tube is filled with coolant and it cools down the hot tool holder. While the tube is moving up, it moves the coil back in to the start position without the need of pneumatic or and mechanical accessories.
                            The new Pyrometer Technology
                            The Pyrometer technology was developed for an easy shrink fit process where minimal temperature will be applied to the tool holder that is necessary to make the shrink process work. This prevents overheating of the tool holders, a well know problem in shrink fit technology. Uncontrolled energy input and high power of the shrink fit machine is not the right solution, only controlled temperature guarantees a smooth shrink fit process."
