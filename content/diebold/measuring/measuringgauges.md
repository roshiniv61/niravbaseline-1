long_desc : "Taper gauges for measuring the shape and position of the taper. The cone diameter is measured over the plane distance, the cone angle over spotting.
With alignment tools you can check the rotation angle position with high precision
Setting gauges for the drawbar position and the monitoring sensors of the tool clamping in your spindle guarantee a smooth production process
Balancing masters for HSK and SK spindles keep your clamping elements permanently in position during the unbalance measurement. For a perfect measurement result! "
