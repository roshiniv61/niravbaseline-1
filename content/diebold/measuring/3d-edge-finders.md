short_desc : " Find and set your reference point easily and safely in all 3 axes with just one device "
long_desc : " Diebold 3D edge finders are used to precisely search for and set workpiece reference points in all 3 axes. 
                    The 3Deco is a compression-type edge finder in which the dial gauge and the feeler mechanism are protected from damage, even if a workpiece is accidentally run over. The buttons have a predetermined breaking point for this."
