short_desc : " The clamping force can be checked in seconds and this is completely independent of the temperature "
long_desc : " Mechanical clamping force testers from Diebold are used to check the pull-in forces of clamping systems in machine spindles.
                    Tiring spring assemblies, dry running or wear and tear can reduce the pull-in forces of the clamping elements in the spindle. The plane tension on HSK tools is then too low. As a result, the bending stiffness, the concentricity and the changing accuracy of the HSK interface suffer. The result is faster wear of the spindle and tool holders. Expensive consequential damage to the machine and workpiece can thus be avoided.
                    They are particularly suitable for service technicians because the clamping force testers work independently of the temperature. They can be used immediately at the beginning of a mission without any previous temperature control.
                    The mechanical clamping force testers from Diebold are characterized by their accuracy (measuring accuracy Â± 3%) and robustness. Inexpensive and reliable, without electronics."
