short_desc : " Measure all functional dimensions of your tool holders with too high a precision. Taper dimensions, clamping shoulder, impression depth, gripper groove, axial runout and runout "
long_desc : "Ever cheaper tool holders come onto the world market every day. The quality always suffers due to the enormous price pressure. At first you don't see this in the recordings. However, the functional dimensions such as the taper angle, taper diameter and clamping shoulder slope cannot be checked without suitable measuring devices. Inaccurate tool holders not only lead to poor machining results, but also lead to spindle damage.
                    The high-precision HSK taper gauges from Diebold ensure that you can check all functional dimensions quickly and safely and thus avoid spindle damage."
