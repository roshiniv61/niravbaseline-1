long_desc : "Diebold Goldring tool holders are manufactured with the highest precision and decades of experience. Already during the development - before the standardization in 1996 - we were active as a manufacturer of the first HSK tool holders and HSK spindles. Based on this experience, we later even became a manufacturer of taper measuring devices in order to guarantee you the highest possible precision for the seat of the tools in the machine.
We manufacture gold ring tool holders according to DIN 69893, DIN 69871 and MAS BT. Remaining stocks are still available for DIN 2080. Just ask about this. Made in Germany means 'Made in Jungingen'
Under this motto, we have been producing Goldring tool holders for over 66 years at our sole location and in fully air-conditioned rooms in Jungingen."
