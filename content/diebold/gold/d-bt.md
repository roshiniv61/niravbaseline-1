long_desc : "D-BT tool holders are Diebold BT chucks with a planar system, i.e. similar to the HSK interface, the important function of which is the planar system and plan support. Despite the flat system, these component holders can also be used on machines with standard component spindles that do not have a flat system. The D-BT tool holders show their true strength precisely through their flat contact in the machine spindle. Here you benefit from maximum concentricity, very rigid clamping, high power transmission and absolute stability for your milling process."
