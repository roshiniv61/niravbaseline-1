long_desc : "Power chucks for heavy-duty machining.
The Diebold UltraGrip® power chucks were specially developed for heavy-duty machining. They are characterized by the highest possible clamping forces and, thanks to their special design, also have vibration-damping properties. The combination of high concentricity, paired with the maximum possible clamping forces, is unique in this form. The entire area of ​​HPC milling with large cutting depths combined with high feed rates and extreme cutting forces is thus completely covered.
• maximum clamping forces
• vibration-damping design
• high cutting depths
• high feed rates"
