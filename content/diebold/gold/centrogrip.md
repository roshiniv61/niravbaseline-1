-Runout <3 µm in the system
- 50% higher holding forces
- Vibration dampened
- No air turbulence "
long_desc : "The high-precision CentroGrip® collet chucks from Diebold guarantee the best possible concentricity. The chuck body has a concentricity of <1 µm from the outer to the inner taper, the collets <2 µm. This results in a system concentricity on the clamped milling cutter shaft in 3xD of <3µm.
The rotationally symmetrical and multi-part structure results in the best damping behavior. The smooth clamping nuts prevent air turbulence and vibrations such as those caused by classic clamping nuts.
This is why CentroGrip® is a must for your machining in the HSC area!"
