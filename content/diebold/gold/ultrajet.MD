short_desc    : "Strongest holding power on the market. Ideal for heavy-duty machining. With nozzle ring for coolant application." 
long_desc : "UltraJet chucks are power chucks with the highest holding force and are therefore ideally suited for use in heavy-duty machining. Equipped with an UltaJet nozzle ring, they ensure optimal lubrication and cooling. A nozzle ring for coolant discharge is installed on the stin side. The coolant (or MQL or just air) is fed through the UltraJet® 3.0 mount and sprayed onto the cutting tool with high pressure through the ingenious nozzle arrangement on the line side of the chuck. Cooling is therefore always available on the tool. The Venturi effect keeps the mixture on the cutting edge of the tool regardless of the speed. This ensures optimal cooling and lubrication and the resulting chips are effectively blown away in milliseconds. When using the new UltraJet® 3. 0, it is almost impossible to run over the chips in heavy-duty machining, which leads to even higher cutting values ​​and significantly longer tool life. That saves real money.";
