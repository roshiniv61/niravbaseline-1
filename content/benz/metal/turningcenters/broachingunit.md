long_desc   : "Broaching units from BENZ make it possible to machine materials that have high tensile strength. An eccentric is used to convert rotary motion from the drive shaft into linear motion on the drive side. The plunger dips into the workpiece with the cutter and removes material after the shaping process using the integrated lift-off device. At the same time, the lift-off device avoids wear and prevents the cutter from breaking during the return motion coming out of the workpiece. "
