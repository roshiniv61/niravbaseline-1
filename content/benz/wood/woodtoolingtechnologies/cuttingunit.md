long_desc   : "Where wood previously dominated, today you see materials like leather or textiles moving into the production process. Leather-covered seating, foamed-lined instrument cases or lampshades made of pieced-together veneer parts—the list of application examples is long. Despite this new mix of materials, nothing changes for you in production. Thanks to the BENZ SECO cutting unit, you do not need any special machines. Rather, you are able to cut these materials easily on your CNC machine—and without any splintering.  "
