long_desc: "It's not without reason that five-axis machining is considered the elite of machining processes. Its complexity requires a great deal of competence with the utilized technologies. But the results are worth the effort: Even complex parts can be completed with extraordinary surface quality, and with high dimensional and shape precision, with just one clamping operation. Subsequent steps in the process can be partially or completely eliminated, enabling new and efficient process chains."
