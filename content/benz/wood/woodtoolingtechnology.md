long_desc   : "With individual machine elements, it can be like a puzzle. They all have to fit together precisely to achieve the total picture that you want. For the use of exchangeable units at your machining center, this means: A unit's machine connection must be precisely matched to the C-axis and the motor spindle. Only in this way is the power unit anchored in a stable manner in the machine and secured against twisting during machining. It is even better if you can obtain all components from a single source. Then they already innately fit to one another perfectly. Apart from exchangeable assemblies, we also offer you C-axes and motor spindles, as well as further components.  "
